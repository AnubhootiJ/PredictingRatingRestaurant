# ML Model - Predicting the Rating of Restaurant
The following project includes machine learning models to predict the ratings of a restaurant based on past reviews. It first visualizes the dataset, then create models using 5 algorithms, then compare those models using MAE (Mean absolute error) value. It further dumps the best model as a pki file to be used for predicting the rating on inputs given by a user. 

The files this repository includes are -
- Assets -> the folder contains all the visualization figures
- Models.py -> A python file with the various models I built for predicting the rating of a restaurant
- RF_model.pki -> The best model dumped as pki file
- UseModel.py -> A python file using the pki file to predict rating after getting input from the user
- Visualization.py -> Visualizing the data before creating the model
- ZomatoDelhi.csv -> the dataset used in the project

You can read in detail about the model here -

Note : I submitted this as my Minor Project in college back in December 2018
